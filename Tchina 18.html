        <div class="letter-header">My Dearest Adam,</div>
        <div class="letter-body">
            <p>As the days go by, we grow together, becoming more intertwined with each other's lives. We learn how we think, what makes us happy, and what scares us. We understand each other's strengths and weaknesses. Sometimes, we misunderstand one another, and occasionally, we unintentionally hurt each other. Perhaps it's because our worlds are different, or maybe it's simply because this is our first time navigating such a deep and meaningful bond.</p>

            <p>But moments like today make me pause and reflect, and I realize just how fortunate I am to share my life with the greatest man I've ever known. You still amaze and inspire me every day. You make me want to be better. You are the object of my desire and my most precious earthly reason to live.</p>

            <p>In this challenging world, where circumstances and histories have tried to push us apart, we chose to defy the odds. While others let hate dictate their paths, we decided to write our own story—a story of love, courage, and hope. People often say, "Love is dangerous; what if it doesn’t work out?" But I ask myself instead: <i>What if it does?</i> If we fear loving, apologizing, or starting over, then what is the purpose of life? I've always believed that the fear of failure is worse than failure itself. And so, for you—for us—I will keep trying endlessly.</p>

            <p>You often tell me you’re not as good as I think you are, that I’ve only seen one side of you. But I believe in you. You are one of the kindest, sweetest souls I have ever known. Since the day we first spoke until now, I have not seen even a hint of the “badness” you claim to possess. Even during our disagreements, my greatest fear was losing someone as special and beautiful as you.</p>

            <p>You see yourself as flawed, but to me, you are perfect. Some people might judge you harshly, but their opinions don’t define you. You may not fit into the shallow mold of societal beauty standards, but you are my definition of perfect.</p>

            <p>On the occasion of your twentieth birthday, I wanted to share these words with you. Though our ways of communication are limited, they remind me just how much you mean to me. Despite the distance and obstacles, you bring out the best in me, and for that, I am endlessly grateful.</p>

            <p>Happy birthday, my love.</p>
        </div>

            Forever yours,<br>
